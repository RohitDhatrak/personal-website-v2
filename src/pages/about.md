I'm Rohit Dhatrak, a software developer with over two years of experience, I focus on developing reliable and efficient backend systems. My expertise lies in Golang, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Redis, allowing me to design optimized data-driven systems.

Beyond backend development, I am proficient in cloud technologies (AWS) and containerization (Docker). Additionally, I have full-stack development experience using Node.js, JavaScript, and React.js, enabling me to create  comprehensive solutions that integrate robust backend architecture with dynamic front-end experiences.

I excel in fast-paced environments where I can tackle complex problems, build perfomant systems, and contribute to innovative software solutions. Passionate about continuous learning and growth, I am always exploring new technologies and following my curiosity.

Let's connect and build something great together!
